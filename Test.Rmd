## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(pls)
library(caret)
set.seed(1)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y = mtcars$hp,
                               ## the outcome data are needed
                               p = .75,
                               ## The percentage of data in the
                               ## training set
                               list = F)
training <- mtcars[ inTrain,] # 114
training

testing <- mtcars[-inTrain,] # 36


ctrl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                     repeats = 5,
                     classProbs = TRUE)
set.seed(2)
plsFitIris <- train(hp ~ .,
                   data = training,
                   method = "pls",
                   tuneLength = 4,
                   trControl = ctrl,
                   preProc = c("center", "scale"))


testing_new <- testing %>% 
  mutate(fitted_hp = predict(plsFitIris, newdata = testing))

testing_new %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = hp, y = fitted_hp))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
